## What is this?

Hi. I am Harper and I do a LOT of video chats.

I built this website awhile back because I found myself glancing around my screen during video calls. I was never looking at the camera.  

I started by blocking the video chat with another window to stop myself from being distracted by the other participants or my own self view. I then started putting sticky notes on my monitor to remind myself to look at the camera.

This website is merging those two ideas to remind me to look at the camera.  


## Hope this helps

It certainly is helping me. It is weird and funny.  

You can tweak it and fuck with it if y ou a re interested. The source is on github: [harperreed/look-at-the-camera](https://github.com/harperreed/look-at-the-camera)

Would love help making it better.
